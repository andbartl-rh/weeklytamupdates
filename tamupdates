  - The customer portal will start validating emails day-after-tomorrow, Thursday, 9/28. When you login to the portal, it should generate an automated email to you. Just follow the directions in the auto-generated email and that should take care of it. If you've changed emails since you set up your portal account, be sure to update your correct email address in the portal, so the validation notifies the correct email, so you don't run into hassles logging in.
