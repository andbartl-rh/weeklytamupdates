- A vulnerability was discovered in how the Go programming language implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There were insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that could be sent within a single stream. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this by sending packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service.
