  - Clusters updating out of 4.10.14, 4.10.15, 4.10.16, 4.10.17, 4.10.18, and 4.10.19 may, depending on their past history, fail to initiate the update as the pod retrieving the target release collides with previous release data. In order to avoid this trouble, we recommend avoiding updates to these releases. This issue is fixed in 4.10.20 and later.
