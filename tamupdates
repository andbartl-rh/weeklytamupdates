- [CVE-2024-2961](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-2961) - An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the ISO-2022-CN-EXT plugin for glibc's iconv library. When converting from UCS4 charset, adding certain escape charterers is required to indicate where the charset was changed to the library. During this process, iconv improperly checks the boundaries of internal buffers, leading to a buffer overflow, which allows writing up to 3 bytes outside the desired memory location. This issue may allow an attacker to craft a malicious characters sequence that will trigger the out-of-bounds write and perform remote code execution, presenting a high impact to the Integrity, Confidentiality, and Availability triad. This is fixed in:

- Two privilege escalation vulnerabilities have been identified in the build process of recent versions of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

    - [CVE-2024-7387](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-7387)  - A flaw was found in openshift/builder. This vulnerability allows command injection via path traversal, where a malicious user can execute arbitrary commands on the OpenShift node running the builder container. When using the “Docker” strategy, executable files inside the privileged build container can be overridden using the spec.source.secrets.secret.destinationDir attribute of the BuildConfig definition. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.

    - [CVE-2024-45496](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-45496)  - A flaw was found in OpenShift. This issue occurs due to the misuse of elevated privileges in the OpenShift Container Platform's build process. During the build initialization step, the git-clone container is run with a privileged security context, allowing unrestricted access to the node. An attacker with developer-level access can provide a crafted .gitconfig file containing commands executed during the cloning process, leading to arbitrary command execution on the worker node. An attacker running code in a privileged container could escalate their permissions on the node running the container.

- OpenShift MachineConfig to mitigate CVE-2024-6387 
A race condition was discovered in OpenSSH's server (sshd) where the SIGALRM handler is called asynchronously after LoginGraceTime seconds if the client doesn't authenticate. This handler uses non-async-signal-safe functions like syslog(), causing potential issues.
	- To mitigate this issue you can set the LoginGraceTime to 0. This will prevent unauthenticated sessions from being kept open but can lead to a denial of service if all connection slots are used.
    - To apply the mitigation for CVE-2024-6387 on certain OpenShift Container Platform Nodes, follow the steps documented in [this solution article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7077080).
Note that the sshd server will still be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks due to the possibility os MaxStartups connection exhaustion, however it'll be safe against the possible remote code execution attacks.
- CVE-2024-5154 cri-o: malicious container can create symlink on host	
    - A flaw was found in cri-o. A malicious container can create a symbolic link pointing to an arbitrary directory or file on the host via directory traversal (“../“). This flaw allows the container to read and write to arbitrary files on the host system. Because this is a full container breakout, SELinux and/or Security Context Constraints (SCC) are both unable to mitigate or prevent the exploit from happening. Customers are requested to update Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 to a version containing the fix for this vulnerability.

- To maintain relevance with the current business needs, Red Hat has refreshed its Support Severity level definitions. The new definitions have a focus on the Business Operations rather than the operating environment. The new definitions are now published [here](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/severity).
- Beginning April 30, Red Hat product documentation will be available at docs.redhat.com. Customer Portal docs will remain available with messaging to invite users to try the new experience. On May 15, all traffic to product documentation on the Customer Portal will be redirected to docs.redhat.com.
- A vulnerability was discovered in how the Go programming language implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There were insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that could be sent within a single stream. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this by sending packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service.
